## The Sagemaker studio error states: Failed to change instance; what should I do?

Error message:

![](./screenshots/failed_to_change_instace.png)

- What a few minutes. The instance is currently starting or stopping. After around 5-10 min, you should be able to either use it or start it again. 
- Please check the resources tab in the left pane of Sagemaker Studio for more information of your current instances.
- If you see the instance there, please make sure to select the kernel image first and afterwards the instance, if necessary.  
 
## When opening a Tutorial, the Sagemaker studio seems to be stuck in the state "Starting notebook kernel"

- It takes about 3-5 minutes to start a new kernel session so please be patient. If it wasn't loaded after 10 minutes, try to refresh your browser. 
- If it still loads, try to shut down all running apps / instances.

## AWS CLI doesn't work in sagemaker studio notebooks

- Reason: The image that we are using for the challenge doesn't support the AWS command line interface (cli) due to incompatible licenses in required packages.
- Workaround: Open an <b> system </b> terminal via the launcher. You can use the aws cli here. The filesystem is shared between all terminals / instances.

- The budget will by dynamic, depending on the number and activity of the teams.

## Can we use any component of AWS once we get access to the environment?

## The AWS will be provided with GPU instances for training, correct? 

- Yes, each team will have one Graphics Processing Unit (GPU) instance at their disposal.

## How to check AWS service expenses?

- On AWS Console, go to 'Billing' and click "Cost Explorer" on the left. You can see your cost summary after choosing "Launch Cost Explorer".

## How do you best collaborate with Sagemaker

- Use some planning tool like trello or the teams planer to structure tasks. As long as you are in the ideation phase, use a different notebook for each team member. If you need branches, do one check out per team member. Then everybody works on their own directory.
