## My persona interviews are failing or returning errors

- Check that you have set up the Mistral API Key
- Check that you're using the correct persona API endpoint and authentication
- Ensure you haven't exceeded the daily limit of TODO conversations per persona
- Verify your conversation hasn't exceeded the TODO message limit
- Check your AWS credentials are properly configured for API authentication
- If a conversation gets stuck, you can start a new conversation with a different conversation_id

## How many times can we re-submit our improved solution?

- You can make **TODO submission per day**
- Each submission will be automatically evaluated against a test dataset.
- Be mindful of your API costs when developing and testing your solution, as each API call to services like Mistral will incur charges.

## How much will API calls cost during development?

- API costs depend on your usage patterns. Based on tutorial examples:
  - Persona interviews: ~$0.02 per persona with medium model
  - Data extraction: ~$0.001 per extraction with small model  
  - Semantic matching: ~$0.05 per persona with medium model
- Budget approximately $5-10 for full development and testing of 100 personas
- Use the cost tracking utilities provided in the tutorials to monitor your spending

## What to do if the submission format check fails?
- If the submission format check fails see what the message says. Oftentimes you will receive a clear message on what was not okay with the format you provided.
- If the local function for validation passes and the remote one fails, check if you accidentally did not introduce any changes to the local code.

## How long does it take to get the AWS links or registration confirmation after the team registration has been done? 

- The registration confirmation should be immediate, in case of any troubles we would appreciate your 
 patience. The AWS accounts will be open after the kick-off on September 17th.

## How can I access my AWS account? 

1. Once you are part of a team, you can log in to your AWS accounts using the below credentials:
   - Go to [AWS access portal](https://gdsc22.awsapps.com/start#/).
   - Use your Capgemini email to log in (the same one used for registration in GDSC).
   - You will receive an email from WAS to verify your identity.
   - Once verified you can log in to your account.
2. You can see the name of your account displayed on [your team page](https://gdsc.ce.capgemini.com/app/portal/).
3. For future logins, you can directly click on  https://gdsc22.awsapps.com/start#/ 

## The Sagemaker studio error states: Failed to change instance; what should I do?

Error message:

![](./screenshots/failed_to_change_instace.png)

- What a few minutes. The instance is currently starting or stopping. After around 5-10 min, you should be able to either use it or start it again. 
- Please check the resources tab in the left pane of Sagemaker Studio for more information of your current instances.
- If you see the instance there, please make sure to select the kernel image first and afterwards the instance, if necessary.  
 
## When opening a Tutorial, the Sagemaker studio seems to be stuck in the state "Starting notebook kernel"

- It takes about 3-5 minutes to start a new kernel session so please be patient. If it wasn't loaded after 10 minutes, try to refresh your browser. 
- If it still loads, try to shut down all running apps / instances.

## AWS CLI doesn't work in sagemaker studio notebooks

- Reason: The image that we are using for the challenge doesn't support the AWS command line interface (cli) due to incompatible licenses in required packages.
- Workaround: Open an <b> system </b> terminal via the launcher. You can use the aws cli here. The filesystem is shared between all terminals / instances.

## What is the weekly budget for AWS? 

- The budget will by dynamic, depending on the number and activity of the teams.
- The initial budget is $50 per week, which will be revised a tad bit every week by the administrators.
- Your credit can get carry over for a month post which they would lapse.

## Can we use any component of AWS once we get access to the environment? 

- Not quite. You have access to everything youâ€™ll need to build a successful solution. Services that are not required are disabled.

## How to check AWS service expenses?

- On AWS Console, go to 'Billing' and click "Cost Explorer" on the left. You can see your cost summary after choosing "Launch Cost Explorer".

## How do you best collaborate with Sagemaker

- Use some planning tool like trello or the teams planer to structure tasks. As long as you are in the ideation phase, use a different notebook for each team member. If you need branches, do one check out per team member. Then everybody works on their own directory.

## How do I set up my Mistral API key?

- Sign up for a Mistral account at [https://mistral.ai/](https://mistral.ai/)
- Generate an API key from your Mistral dashboard
- Store it in your `.env` file as `MISTRAL_API_KEY=your_key_here`
- Never commit your API key to version control
- The tutorials include detailed setup instructions

## How do I manage costs while developing my AI agents?

- Use the cost tracking utilities provided in `src/utils.py`:
  - `track_api_call()` to monitor each API call
  - `print_cost_summary()` to see your spending
  - `reset_cost_tracker()` to start fresh tracking
- Start with small model testing (cheaper) before using medium/large models
- Test with fewer personas first (e.g., 5-10) before processing all 100
- Cache processed data to avoid re-processing the same information

## What are personas and how do I interview them?

- Personas are simulated job seekers with unique profiles, skills, and preferences
- You interview them via API calls to gather information about their background
- Each persona has a daily limit of TODO conversations with TODO messages max per conversation
- Use structured questions to efficiently gather: name, skills, location, age, and experience
- The tutorials provide example interview strategies and conversation patterns
