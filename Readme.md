## Where do I find the videos for the Tutorials?

- You can find the videos on the [resources page](https://gdsc.ce.capgemini.com/app/portal/resources/) which will be visible after logging in.

## Can we have the kickoff session PowerPoint?

- The PowerPoint presentation will be available on Teams. You would also find it on the [resources page](https://gdsc.ce.capgemini.com/app/portal/resources).

## When do we receive access to the dataset? 

- Access to the dataset will be provided after the kick-off on September 30th.

## Database credentials don't work

- Check where did you get the credentials from. The correct version can be found in tutorial 2 and 3
 that you can access via SageMaker or CodeCommit. Credentials in the **video tutorial 2** are **out of date**!

## How many times can we re-submit our improved solution?

- You can re-submit your improved solution as often as you want. 
However, because of this year's evaluation method there were introduced additional constraints. We need you as
evaluators of battles of other participants' submissions and therefore your team has to rate a specific
number of battles before a new submission. First two are free, for the third one requires 10 rated battles and
the number grows from that value to a stable 50 battles per submission. The number of required battles for your
team is displayed at the [arena page](https://gdsc.ce.capgemini.com/app/arena/).

## Why do I have to rate battles?
- Since submissions are evaluated by competing on the arena and there is almost no automatic evaluation, 
this system had to be implemented because having a large number of submissions requires a lot of battles 
for adequate ranking.

## What to do if the automatic evaluation fails?
- If the automatic evaluation fails that means your new submission did not answer correctly, timed out or another unexpected error occured. The reason is displayed on the the team's website:
  - "Unexpected error" - this status means there were issues with starting the `app.py` script. Chceck your submission implementation and `create_submission` function implementation. In some cases more specific error might occure:
    - Submission code error - this means that the app started but there was an error somewhere while executing your code.
    - Endpoint unreachable - this means there is an error that stops the application from launching (the docker image works but the app is not responsive).
  - "Timeout" - this status means that your submission failed to answer to at least one of automatic evaluation questions in time.
  - "Incorrect answers" - this status means that at least one of the answers was not correct. 

## My submission status says *"Is progress"* for a long time.
- Evaluation may take up to 1 hour. If the displayed status is "In progress" for a suspiciously long period 
of time, that being a few hours, please contact GDSC organizers.

## How long does it take to get the AWS links or registration confirmation after the team registration has been done? 

- The registration confirmation should be immediate, in case of any troubles we would appreciate your 
 patience. The AWS accounts will be open after the kick-off on September 30th.

## How can I access my AWS account? 

1. Once you are part of a team, you can log in to your AWS accounts using the below credentials:
   - Go to [AWS access portal](https://gdsc22.awsapps.com/start#/).
   - Use your Capgemini email to log in (the same one used for registration in GDSC).
   - You will receive an email from WAS to verify your identity.
   - Once verified you can log in to your account.
2. You can see the name of your account displayed on [your team page](https://gdsc.ce.capgemini.com/app/portal/).
3. For future logins, you can directly click on  https://gdsc22.awsapps.com/start#/ 

## The Sagemaker studio error states: Failed to change instance; what should I do?

Error message:

![](./screenshots/failed_to_change_instace.png)

- What a few minutes. The instance is currently starting or stopping. After around 5-10 min, you should be able to either use it or start it again. 
- Please check the resources tab in the left pane of Sagemaker Studio for more information of your current instances.
- If you see the instance there, please make sure to select the kernel image first and afterwards the instance, if necessary.  
 
## When opening a Tutorial, the Sagemaker studio seems to be stuck in the state "Starting notebook kernel"

- It takes about 3-5 minutes to start a new kernel session so please be patient. If it wasn't loaded after 10 minutes, try to refresh your browser. 
- If it still loads, try to shut down all running apps / instances.

## AWS CLI doesn't work in sagemaker studio notebooks

- Reason: The image that we are using for the challenge doesn't support the AWS command line interface (cli) due to incompatible licenses in required packages.
- Workaround: Open an <b> system </b> terminal via the launcher. You can use the aws cli here. The filesystem is shared between all terminals / instances.

## What is the weekly budget for AWS? 

- The budget will by dynamic, depending on the number and activity of the teams.
- The initial budget is $50 per week, which will be revised a tad bit every week by the administrators.
- Your credit can get carry over for a month post which they would lapse.

## Can we use any component of AWS once we get access to the environment? 

- Not quite. You have access to everything you’ll need to build a successful solution. Services that are not required are disabled.

## How to check AWS service expenses?

- On AWS Console, go to 'Billing' and click "Cost Explorer" on the left. You can see your cost summary after choosing "Launch Cost Explorer".

## How do you best collaborate with Sagemaker

- Use some planning tool like trello or the teams planer to structure tasks. As long as you are in the ideation phase, use a different notebook for each team member. If you need branches, do one check out per team member. Then everybody works on their own directory.
